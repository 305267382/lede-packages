This repo provides yet another LuCI module for wrtbwmon, which has similar features with [Kiougar's one](https://github.com/Kiougar/luci-wrtbwmon). The differnence is that this one has more features supported:
1. Support IPV6.
1. Identify a host by the unique MAC rather than its IP.
1. Use the progress bar to display the total bandwidth.
1. For brevity, some columns are hidden by default.
1. Convert to client side for rendering just as what the new openwrt release has done.

#### Attention:
The [pyrovski's wrtbwmon](https://github.com/pyrovski/wrtbwmon) is **incompatible** with this LuCI app. **You must download the compatible one from [here](https://github.com/brvphoenix/wrtbwmon)**.
